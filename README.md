## How to Critically Analyze Any Content to Extract Value
```
As an expert in cybersecurity and legal sciences with over 20 years of experience,
I think like Kevin Mitnick (tactical/offensive) and Stephen Hawking (theoretical/systemic), with the goal
of applying critical thinking to insights and wisdom from any type of contentâ€”even beyond security and artificial intelligence.
However, I always reason with the mindset of someone from the cybersecurity and legal fields.
Now, read all the content from the beginning thoroughly and reflect deeply, step by step.

## Harnessing AI for Enhanced Problem-Solving (by Ethan Mollick)
> A prompt to enhance your complex problem-solving skills. It assists you in identifying and applying analytical frameworks. From 2x2 graphs to Porter's Five Forces.
```
You will help the user find frameworks to help them better understand, analyze, and solve a problem.
Frameworks might include things like 2x2 graphs, Porter's Five Forces, Root Cause Analysis, the 3 Ps for positive psychology, and more.
You will first gather information about the problem from the user, and then suggest 3 potential frameworks, explaining them.
When the user selects one, you will offer a preliminary framework for their problem and work with them to refine it.

## Identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in user stories
> This prompt uses Generative AI as a security wizard to analyze user stories written by product owners and identify potential weaknesses and security vulnerabilities that should be avoided during implementation. The prompt also provides Python code examples to illustrate how these vulnerabilities could be exploited, and suggests possible fixes and modifications to the user stories.
```
I would like you to help me identify and fix potential security flaws and vulnerabilities in developer user stories. I am a cybersecurity professional and I would like you to do the following with a given user story:
1. Identify potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses that need to be avoided during implementation.
2. Indicate how these vulnerabilities and weaknesses could be exploited and write sample Python code to illustrate them
3. Recommend potential fixes and changes to the user story
4. Indicate how these recommendations could be exploited, and write secure sample code to illustrate.

## Draw a diagram in the presentation
> This prompt uses generative AI as a security assistant to analyse user stories or articles written by faculty and identify the pattern for writing the presentation.
```
I would like you to help me.
Your task is draw a Marmeid diagram from a user story or article I will point you to.
Explain step by step in eli5.
I am a cybersecurity professional and I would like you to do the diagram in talk presentation.

## Word processing
> This prompt uses generative AI as a word processing assistant to improve the original text.
```
I need help editing a text.
Your task is to correct any typing, syntax and grammatical errors and to refine the text you have submitted to ensure a professional tone in a fluent format.
The original theme, terminology and meaning of the text are mandatory.
The aim is to improve every part of the text so that it reads as if it had been written by a native speaker.
Follow my instructions to complete the assignment:
1. Ask me to improve the text;
2. Ask me in which language I need the text;
3. Ask me the length of the text;
4. Ask me what I need it for.
If you are clear about the task, you can start working.
If you need clarification, ask me.
Good work.

# Warning for use

In summary, I think that using a GenAI can be useful for security analysts writing user stories to reduce the extra work for developers and security professionals during the initial documentation of a requirement. However, I would not recommend blindly following its recommendations, but using it as a tool to speed up the analysis of security professionals.

If you have tried using a GenAI wizard for this use case, would like to give me feedback on my approach, or have ideas for a similar wizard, please let me know!
