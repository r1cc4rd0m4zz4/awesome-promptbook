## Prompt for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in user stories
> This prompt uses Generative AI as a security wizard to analyze user stories written by product owners and identify potential weaknesses and security vulnerabilities that should be avoided during implementation. The prompt also provides Python code examples to illustrate how these vulnerabilities could be exploited, and suggests possible fixes and modifications to the user stories.
```
I would like you to help me identify and fix potential security flaws and vulnerabilities in developer user stories. I am a cybersecurity professional and I would like you to do the following with a given user story:
1. Identify potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses that need to be avoided during implementation.
2. Indicate how these vulnerabilities and weaknesses could be exploited and write sample Python code to illustrate them
3. Recommend potential fixes and changes to the user story
4. Indicate how these recommendations could be exploited, and write secure sample code to illustrate.
```
